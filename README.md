# ecore-csharp

CrossEcore is a framework for model-based software engineering targeting multiple platforms.
From a platform-independent class model (i.e. an Ecore model), source code for multiple platforms like C#, TypeScript, JavaScript and Swift is generated.
Derived attributes, constraints for model validation and operation bodies can be expressed in the [Object Constraint Language (OCL)](http://www.omg.org/spec/OCL/About-OCL/).
CrossEcore comes with a runtime library for every target platform that implements the Ecore and OCL API.
The Ecore API provides many of the features that are known from the [Eclipse Modeling Framework](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/), e.g., persistence, reflection, notifications, switches, factories, referential integrity and validation.
With the aid of an OCL Compiler, OCL expressions are translated to equivalent expressions of the target programming language.
CrossEcoreâ€™s APIs can be used across platforms almost consistently.
